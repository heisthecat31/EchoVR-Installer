If you had EchoVR before the shutdown choose Legacy option, if you are on a quest 3 and want better graphics choose Quest 3 Better Graphics option: note this is only for Legacy players
If you did not own EchoVR before shutdown then choose new player option and join the echo vr patcher server to get your personalised apk to be able to play echo vr.

After installing make sure echo vr has permissions granted and then download the game data, afterwards echo will open, if you open echo vr before doing these two things and the game crashes immediately then restart your headset.
